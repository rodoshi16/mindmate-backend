Trees: Do not have a linear order, they have a hierarchical structure where each
node is connected to multiple nodes.

A collection of values with directed EDGES between them and NO CYCLES

Tree terminology:

Tree is either empty or non-empty (non-empty tree has a root connected to
0 or more subtrees)

* size - number of nodes in a tree
* path - sequence of nodes where there is an edge between each pair
* leaf - a node with no subtrees
* height - the number of values on the longest path of a tree

The relationship between the height of the tree and the height of the subtree: 1 + height of subtree
Depth: number of nodes, empty trees have a depth of zero.
Children: A value directly connected underneath another value. Number of children is
the same as the number of subtrees.  sum of leaves of all subtrees = number of leaves of a tree

Branching factor - the max num of children of a tree
Subtree - a non- empty tree that represents a child node as well its descendants
leaf is also a subtree



subtree: list[Tree]
